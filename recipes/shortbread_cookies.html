            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Originating from Scotland, shortbread cookies are traditionally made of butter, sugar, and flour. In contrast to most cookies, shortbread does not use any leavening agents, resulting in the cookies' trademark feature of crumbling in your mouth.</p>
                <p>Shortbread cookies are extremely easy to bake, requiring only commonly used baking ingredients and tools. They can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature for up to a week, a few days longer if in the fridge, and up to three months if stored in the freezer.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups butter, softened</li>
                    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Cream softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in vanilla; add flour and mix well until combined.</li>
                    <li>Fill cookie press with the dough and form cookies onto two ungreased cookie sheets, spacing them about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake for 10 - 12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are just starting to turn golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Remove the cookie sheets from the oven, and set them on a wire cooling rack for 2 minutes. Then transfer the shortbread cookies to the rack to cool completely.</li>
                </ol>
